                    their websites by themselves, while

                    posts
                    and make them available for reading on their websites. Articles usually appear in a certain order,
                    starting from the most recent ones. They are also divided into categories to enable people to
                    navigate
                    them easily. Besides, blog posts have another unique feature, such as interlinking. This way,
                    bloggers
                    link to other blogs and promote each other to expand their audiences. <br> If you are interested in

                    As an option, you can consider leveraging WordPress since it has special layouts for blogs. The
                    platform
                    enables you to obtain a layout and its design just in a few clicks.</p>
                <p id="write" class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5"><span class="text-dark fw-bold">Write your first
                        blog post</span>. Once you decide on your design, it’s time to create your first piece of
                    content.
                    Bear in mind that to blog successfully, you need to create unique, engaging, informative,
                    interesting,
                    and relatively long posts. It’s not an easy task to always come up with fresh and interesting ideas,
                    but
                    they help attract people, engage them, and make them loyal to your brand. Besides, don’t forget to
                    add
                    some photos to create visually appealing blog posts and simplify the way visitors perceive your
                    content.

                    companies and bloggers promote products with the help of digital and traditional marketing, you
                    can’t remain inactive. Use various forms of ads like PPC, native advertising, pre-roll ads, create
                    email campaigns, and leverage social media channels to popularize your blog. More and more bloggers
                    use paid ads that appear on users’ Instagram Stories and feed. Consider collaborating with other
                    bloggers in your niche, commenting on other famous pages, communicating with your audience, and

                        to
                        make money. You can see several effective ways to earn some extra costs below.</p>
                    <h1 id="conduct" class="fs-2 blog mx-auto text-dark fw-bolder">Conduct courses and workshops</h1>
                    <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">One of the greatest ways to make money online is to create
                        courses.
                        Modern people look for new skills and knowledge that help their personal and career growth. However, due
                        to
                        their often heavy workload, they don’t have a lot of time. That’s why it’s always a problem to go
                        somewhere
                        to directly participate in different events.</p>
                    <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-3"><span class="text-dark fw-bold">Online courses </span> and
                        workshops come to the rescue and help both participants and bloggers. As a blogger, you
                        can connect with your audience through different video platforms and share a topic you specialize in,
                        and
                        your participants can obtain the necessary knowledge.</p>
                    <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">Let’s take Gabrielle Bernstein, for example. The spiritual
                        leader
                        offers readers to buy her courses on relationships, business, and meditation. She earns money by sharing
                        her
                        experience and valuable hands-on tips.</p>

            <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">Bloggers often write sponsored posts on social media
                platforms
                or their websites to get paid by different
                brands. They help draw followers’ attention to a brand or individual promoted. Opinion leaders
                create
                blog posts, videos, or Instagram Stories to bring new customers to a company.</p>
            <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-3">For example, let’s take Madelaine Petsch and Bliss. In the
                Instagram post below, the actress promotes the brand’s sunscreen.</p>
            <img class="blog  img text-center img-fluid  h-100"

            <h1 id="conduct" class="fs-2 blog mx-auto text-dark fw-bolder">Host a paid webinar or training</h1>
            <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">A lot of companies and individuals start with free
                webinars.
                However, if you are an expert in your industry, you can make money on your expertise by organizing
                paid
                training or webinars. To run webinars smoothly, pay attention to details and check your info for
                accuracy. Small errors and typos are unacceptable. Remember to make your training special and unique
                so
                that it can be useful and fresh for participants. If it shows good results, consider making a
                series.
            </p>
            <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-3">For example, Jack Kornfield, an author and Buddist
                practitioner, conducts a seven-week online training
                about the power of awareness.</p>

            <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">One more secondary source of income is affiliate marketing.
                By
                recommending digital products, services,
                and other products of other companies on your blog, you can earn a good commission. This way, you
                get
                paid every time you promote a company.</p>

                <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">Bloggers can get some additional income not only from
                    recommending and promoting other companies but also
                    from writing and selling their own books or ebooks to their audience. By reading books, people can
                    sharpen their knowledge in various industries: marketing, psychology, design, sales, beauty, etc. As
                    an
                    expert, you can communicate your knowledge by creating something unique and fresh. Your readers will
                    appreciate that.</p>
                <p class="blog mx-auto text-secondary  my-5">For example, Becca Ludlum, who has a website and an
                    Instagram
                    page dedicated to nutrition and healthy
                    eating habits, also wrote a new book called “Meal Prep in an Instant.”</p>
